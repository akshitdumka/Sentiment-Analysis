# 📝 Sentiment Analysis Project

This project focuses on performing *Sentiment Analysis* using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.  
The goal is to classify text into different sentiment categories such as *Positive, Negative, and Neutral*.

## 📌 Features
- Text Preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Feature Extraction using *TF-IDF / Bag of Words / Word Embeddings*
- Model Training using *Machine Learning algorithms* (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Supports *custom text input* for live sentiment prediction
